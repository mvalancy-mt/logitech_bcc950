## Creating Embodied AI with the BCC950

The Logitech BCC950 is an excellent platform for creating embodied AI experiences. By combining its mechanical movement with AI capabilities, you can create an interactive presence that feels much more engaging than traditional voice assistants.

### Why It's Perfect for Embodied AI:

1. **Physical Movement**: The pan/tilt capabilities allow your AI to respond physically - turning to face someone when they speak, nodding in agreement, or looking around the room.

2. **Integrated Audio**: The built-in speakerphone and microphone mean your AI can hear and respond without additional hardware.

3. **Strong Presence**: The camera's eye-level positioning and motorized movement create a sense of presence that static webcams can't match.

4. **Programmable Control**: This script provides a foundation for integrating the camera's movement with AI systems.

### Integration Ideas:

- **Voice Assistant Enhancement**: Connect with systems like ChatGPT, Rasa, or other conversational AI platforms and add physical responses.
  
- **Meeting Attendee**: Create an AI participant for meetings that can turn to face the active speaker.
  
- **Smart Home Hub**: Use as a central interface for your smart home, with the ability to look toward activity in different parts of a room.
  
- **Security Monitor**: Combine with computer vision to create a security system that can actively track motion.
  
- **Telepresence**: Enable remote workers to have better presence in meetings with automated tracking and movement.
